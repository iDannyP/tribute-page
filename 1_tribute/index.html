                                <strong>Charles "Chuck" Feeney</strong> is an Irish-American businessman and a former billionaire. Yes, you read that right. <em>Former</em> billionaire. 
                                Feeney amassed a net worth of over $8 billion from his business ventures. He has, over the course of his lifetime, given away almost every penny; 
                                aside from a comparatively frugal $2 million he set aside for his and his wife's retirement, he has donated every last penny - anonymously, mind you - 
                                to various philanthropic causes, all at his enthuasiastic discretion.
